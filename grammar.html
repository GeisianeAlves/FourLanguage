                <h2>Verbs: Tenses (Present, Past, Future)</h2>

                <p>Verb tenses are essential for understanding the timing of actions and events. In English, we have three main tenses: present, past, and future.</p>
              
                <h3>Present Tense</h3>
                <p>The present tense describes actions happening now, habits, and general truths. It has four forms:</p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Simple Present:</strong> Used for habits, routines, general truths, and states.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Example: I drink coffee every morning. (habit)</li>
                      <li>Example: The sun rises in the east. (general truth)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Present Continuous:</strong> Used for actions happening now or around now.

                      <li>Example: I am drinking coffee right now. (action happening now)</li>
                      <li>Example: She is studying for her exams this week. (action around now)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Present Perfect:</strong> Used for actions started in the past and continuing to the present, or for actions at an unspecified past time.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Example: I have lived in this city for five years. (action started in the past and continues)</li>
                      <li>Example: She has visited many countries. (action happened at an unspecified time)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Present Perfect Continuous:</strong> Used for actions started in the past and continuing to the present, emphasizing duration.
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              
                <h3>Past Tense</h3>
                <p>The past tense describes actions that happened in the past. It has two main forms:</p>
              
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Simple Past:</strong> Used for completed actions in the past.

                </ul>
              
                <h3>Future Tense</h3>
                <p>The future tense describes actions that will happen in the future. There are several ways to express the future:</p>
              
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Simple Future (will):</strong> Used for predictions, promises, and decisions made at the moment of speaking.

            <h2>Sentence Structure: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)</h2>

          <p>Understanding sentence structure is key to constructing clear and grammatically correct sentences in English. The most common sentence structure in English is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).</p>

          <h3>What is SVO?</h3>
          <p>SVO is the order in which words typically appear in a basic English sentence:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Subject:</strong> The person, place, thing, or idea that is performing the action.</li>
            <li><strong>Verb:</strong> The action itself.</li>
            <li><strong>Object:</strong> The person, place, thing, or idea that is affected by the action.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Examples:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The cat (subject) chased (verb) the mouse (object).</li>
            <li>She (subject) is reading (verb) a book (object).</li>
            <li>They (subject) will visit (verb) the museum (object) tomorrow (adverb).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Importance of SVO</h3>
          <p>SVO word order helps establish clear meaning in English sentences. It tells us who or what is doing something, what action they are taking, and what is being acted upon.</p>

          <h3>Exceptions and Variations</h3>
          <p>While SVO is the standard word order, there are some exceptions and variations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Questions:</strong> Questions often invert the subject and verb (e.g., "Is she reading a book?").</li>
            <li><strong>Commands:</strong> Commands typically omit the subject (e.g., "Close the door.").</li>
            <li><strong>Emphasis:</strong> For emphasis, the word order can be changed (e.g., "Never have I seen such a beautiful sunset.").</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Practice Makes Perfect</h3>
          <p>The best way to master SVO sentence structure is through practice. Try writing your own sentences and identifying the subject, verb, and object. You can also analyze sentences in books, articles, or conversations to see how SVO is used in context.</p>

          <h3>Key Points</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>SVO is the most common sentence structure in English.</li>
            <li>It follows the order: subject - verb - object.</li>
            <li>This structure provides clarity and helps convey meaning effectively.</li>
            <li>While there are exceptions and variations, understanding SVO is fundamental to building strong English sentences.</li>
          </ul>

          <section class="section-content1" id="articles" style="display: none;">
              <!-- <h2>Articles (A, An, The)</h2> -->
              <div class="box-content">
                <h2>Articles (A, An, The)</h2>
                <p>Articles are small words that come before nouns to help us understand the noun's meaning in context. English has three articles: a, an, and the.</p>
              
                <h3>Indefinite Articles: A and An</h3>
                <p>We use "a" and "an" to refer to a general or non-specific noun. The choice between them depends on the sound that begins the following word:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>A:</strong> Used before words that start with a consonant sound. (e.g., a book, a car, a university)</li>
                  <li><strong>An:</strong> Used before words that start with a vowel sound. (e.g., an apple, an hour, an umbrella)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I saw <strong>a</strong> cat in the street.</li>
                  <li>She is <strong>an</strong> excellent teacher.</li>
                  <li>He wants to buy <strong>a</strong> new car.</li>
                </ul>
              
                <h3>Definite Article: The</h3>
                <p>We use "the" to refer to a specific noun that has already been mentioned or is known to both the speaker and listener.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I saw a cat in the street. <strong>The</strong> cat was black.</li>
                  <li>Can you pass me <strong>the</strong> salt, please?</li>
                  <li><strong>The</strong> sun is shining today.</li>
                </ul>
              
                <h3>When to Use No Article</h3>
                <p>In some cases, we don't use any article at all. This happens with:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Plural nouns in general statements (e.g., Cats are cute.)</li>
                  <li>Uncountable nouns in general statements (e.g., Water is essential for life.)</li>
                  <li>Names of people, countries, cities, etc. (e.g., John, Brazil, New York)</li>
                </ul>
              
                <h3>Key Points</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Articles help clarify the meaning of nouns.</li>
                  <li>"A" and "an" are indefinite articles used for general nouns.</li>
                  <li>"The" is a definite article used for specific nouns.</li>
                  <li>Sometimes, no article is needed.</li>
                </ul>

          <section class="section-content1" id="nouns" style="display: none;">

                  <h2>Nouns: Singular, Plural, Countable, Uncountable</h2>
                
                  <p>Nouns are words that name people, places, things, or ideas. In English, they can be classified as singular or plural, and countable or uncountable.</p>
                
                  <h3>Singular and Plural Nouns</h3>
                  <p><strong>Singular nouns</strong> refer to one person, place, thing, or idea.</p>
                  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> cat, dog, book, chair, apple</p>
                
                  <p><strong>Plural nouns</strong> refer to more than one person, place, thing, or idea. Most plural nouns are formed by adding -s or -es to the singular form.</p>
                  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> cats, dogs, books, chairs, apples</p>
                
                  <p>There are also irregular plural nouns that don't follow these rules.</p>
                  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> man/men, woman/women, child/children, foot/feet, mouse/mice</p>
                
                  <h3>Countable and Uncountable Nouns</h3>
                  <p><strong>Countable nouns</strong> are things that can be counted individually. They can be singular or plural.</p>
                  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> apple, book, car, house, student</p>
                
                  <p><strong>Uncountable nouns</strong> are things that cannot be counted individually. They are always singular.</p>
                  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> water, milk, sugar, rice, information, advice</p>
                
                  <p>Some nouns can be both countable and uncountable, depending on their meaning.</p>
                  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I'd like a glass of <strong>water</strong>. (uncountable)</li>
                    <li>The tap <strong>waters</strong> are contaminated. (countable)</li>

                <p>Pronouns are words that replace nouns in a sentence. They help us avoid repetition and make our language more concise. There are three main types of pronouns: subject, object, and possessive.</p>
              
                <h3>Subject Pronouns</h3>
                <p>Subject pronouns are used as the subject of a sentence, the person or thing performing the action.</p>

                <h2>Adjectives and Adverbs</h2>

                <p>Adjectives and adverbs are essential parts of speech that add depth and detail to our language. They describe and modify other words, making our communication more vivid and precise.</p>
              
                <h3>Adjectives</h3>
                <p>Adjectives modify nouns or pronouns, providing information about their qualities, characteristics, or quantities.</p>
              
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The <strong>red</strong> car is fast.</li>
                  <li>She is a <strong>talented</strong> musician.</li>
                  <li>They have <strong>three</strong> children.</li>
                  <li>He is a <strong>funny</strong> and <strong>intelligent</strong> person.</li>
                </ul>
              
                <p>Adjectives can appear before the noun they modify (attributive position) or after a linking verb (predicative position).</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The <strong>old</strong> house is haunted. (attributive)</li>
                  <li>The house is <strong>old</strong>. (predicative)</li>
                </ul>
              
                <h3>Adverbs</h3>
                <p>Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They provide information about how, when, where, or to what extent an action is performed.</p>
              
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>She sings <strong>beautifully</strong>.</li>
                  <li>He runs <strong>very</strong> fast.</li>
                  <li>They arrived <strong>early</strong>.</li>
                  <li>The food was <strong>absolutely</strong> delicious.</li>
                </ul>
              
                <p>Many adverbs are formed by adding "-ly" to an adjective (e.g., quick - quickly), but there are also many irregular adverbs (e.g., well, fast, hard).</p>
